## Fields

```ts
new(name)
```

new returns an instance of BuildRequest

withEnv(env)
```

"env contains additional environment variables you want to pass into a builder container."

### fn withEnvMixin

```ts
withEnvMixin(env)
```

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn withLastVersion

For example, specifying \"webapp.war\" would place the provided binary as `/webapp.war` for the builder. If left empty, the Docker and Source build strategies assume this file is a zip, tar, or tar.gz file and extract it as the source. The custom strategy receives this binary as standard input. This filename may not contain slashes or be '..' or '.'."
